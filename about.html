    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>My journey in the world of design and technology has been both exciting and fulfilling. From a young age, I’ve always been curious about how things work, whether it was solving problems in tech or exploring my creative side through design. As I pursued my studies in Information Technology, I discovered my love for blending technical skills with creativity, especially in projects that require both. Over the years, I’ve developed a passion for designing in Canva, where I find myself not only learning new techniques but also refining my ability to communicate ideas visually. Each project, whether it’s a pub mat or a presentation, is an opportunity for me to grow and challenge myself further. I am constantly looking for ways to improve and innovate, and I’m excited to continue this journey, combining my technical expertise with my creative vision.</p>
